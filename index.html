    <h2>What is This Workshop?</h2>
    <p>
       The workshop is an informal research conference focusing on interactions of 3 and 4D topology. This event features
       a series of three lectures given by <a href="https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~mpowell/" style="text-decoration: none">Mark Powell</a> (University of Glasgow)
       on 4D topology and 14 one-hour talks on recent trends.
       
    

    <h2>What is It about?</h2>
    <p>
        Two major breakthroughs made by Donaldson and Freedman in the early 1980s revealed a profound distinction 
        between smooth 4-manifolds and topological 4-manifolds. Their work opened floodgates to the study of 4-manifolds 
        in various categories (topological, smooth, symplectic). Over the last two decades, 4-manifold topology and
        3-dimensional topology have become closer than ever. Many exciting research directions have emerged: 
        Various Floer theory for 3-manifolds and knots have been developed; new invariants and obstructions regarding 
        embedding surfaces in 4-manifolds have been introduced; deeper connection to symplectic geometry and quantum topology 
        have been discovered; a better understanding of topology of the diffeomorphism and homeomorphism groups are being resembled; 
        and a program to explore possible role of the Ricci flow in 4-manifolds has been initiated. This workshop will bring together experts 
        working on these areas around the world. We hope the workshop will serve as a platform for reporting on 
        recent progress and exchanging ideas to foster new interactions.

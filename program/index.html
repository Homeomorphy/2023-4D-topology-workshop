                       Heegaard Floer homology. The other invariant of 3-manifolds, with origins in physics, is a certain q-series 
                       defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, which is conjectured to recover quantum invariants of 3-manifolds at roots of

                Abstract: We constructed diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds by surgery along theta-graphs embedded in 4-manifolds. 
               In this talk, I will talk about our results on some properties of theta-graph surgery: nontriviality up to isotopy, extension to pseudo-isotopy, 
               fiberwise positive scalar curvature metrics. To obtain some of such properties, we describe theta-graph surgery by families of 
              framed links of 1- and 2-spheres in 4-manifolds and modify them by an analogue of Kirby calculus. To prove the nontriviality, 
              we use an analogue of Kontsevich's configuration space integral invariant for a two-loop graph, which is in a sense a higher 
              dimensional analogue of the Casson invariant, according to a result by G. Kuperberg and D. Thurston.

               Abstract: Given a compact hyperbolic manifold of dimension \(n\geq 2\) its isometry group is known to be finite.  
              In dimensions \(n\geq 3\), Mostow Rigidity tells us the space of homotopy self-equivalences of the 
              manifold has the isometry group as a deformation-retract.  In dimension 3, due to work of Hatcher, 
              Waldhausen and Gabai, we know the group of homeomorphisms, PL-automorphisms and diffeomorphisms
              also has the isometry group as a deformation-retract.  In dimensions \(\geq 11\), Farrell and Jones used the 
              machinery of Higher Simple Homotopy Theory (K-theory, pseudoisotopy, etc) to show that smooth, PL and 
               topological automorphism groups of compact hyperbolic manifolds do not have the homotopy-type of the 
               isometry group, moreover they do not have the homotopy-type of finite CW-complexes.  We extend these
                results to dimension \(n\geq 4\) by avoiding the use of Higher Simple Homotopy Theory, and constructing diffeomorphisms 
               explicitly using "barbells".

               It has lead to many milestone results, such as the approval of Property P conjecture. Heegaard diagrams, on the other hand, is a 
                combinatorial method to describe and study 3-manifolds. In principle, a Heegaard diagram determines a 3-manifold and hence determines 
               its instanton Floer homology as well. However, no explicit relations between Heegaard diagrams and instanton 
               Floer homology were known until a recent progress by my collaborators and I. In this talk, for a 3-manifold \(Y\), I will 
         present how to extract some information about the instanton Floer homology of \(Y\) from Heegaard diagrams of \(Y\). I will also discuss on
         some applications and possible future directions. This is a joint work with Baldwin and Ye.

              coincides with the functor given by Viro. From a different viewpoint, Zhongtao Wu and I studied the Alexander polynomial for MOY graphs 
             (framed trivalent graph with coloring), which is in fact the Euler characteristic of the Heegaard Floer homology of graphs. 
             We later proved that this polynomial is equivalent to Viro's \(U_q(gl(1|1))\)-polynomial. In this talk, we show how to construct a

                Abstract: A symplectic rational surface is called positive if the pairing between the two degree 2 cohomological invariants, the symplectic class and the first Chern class, is positive. A symplectic rational surface with Euler number up to 12 is positive and a symplectic toric surface is positive. 
              We will discuss some recent results on the geometry of such surfaces. This is based on  joint works with Jun Li, Weiwei Wu, and  with Jie Min and Shengzhen Ning.

                Abstract: For an immersed filling of a topological knot, one can do surgery to resolve a double point with the price of 
                  increasing surface genus by 1. In the Lagrangian analog, one can do Lagrangian surgery on immersed Lagrangian fillings to treat a 
                  double point by a genus. In this talk, we will explore the possibility of reversing the Lagrangian surgery, i.e., compressing a genus into a double point. It turns out that not all Lagrangian surgery are reversible.

                        rather different origins and structures. One is the theory of lattice cohomology, closely related to 
                       Heegaard Floer homology. The other invariant of 3-manifolds, with origins in physics, is a certain q-series 
                       defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, which is conjectured to recover quantum invariants of 3-manifolds at roots of 
                       unity. (Joint work with R. Akhmechet and P. Johnson)

                Abstract: We constructed diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds by surgery along theta-graphs embedded in 4-manifolds. In this talk, 
                I will talk about our results on some properties of theta-graph surgery: nontriviality up to isotopy, extension to pseudo-isotopy, 
                fiberwise positive scalar curvature metrics. To obtain some of such properties, we describe theta-graph surgery by families of 
                framed links of 1- and 2-spheres in 4-manifolds and modify them by an analogue of Kirby calculus. To prove the nontriviality for 
                some 4-manifolds, we use an analogue of Kontsevich's configuration space integral invariant for a two-loop graph, which is in 
                a sense a higher dimensional analogue of the Casson invariant, according to a result by G. Kuperberg, D. Thurston, J. Marché, and C. Lescop. <br>

In each case except that of the unknot, the fiberedness of the knots in question plays a crucial role in the proofs.  In this talk, I'll discuss recent work with John Baldwin in which we show for the first time that both invariants can also detect non-fibered knots, including \(5_2\), and that HOMFLY homology detects infinitely many knots. The key input is a classification of genus-1 knots which are "nearly fibered" from the perspective of knot Floer homology.

              In dimensions \(n\geq 3\), Mostow Rigidity tells us the space of homotopy self-equivalences of the 
              manifold has the isometry group as a deformation-retract.  In dimension 3, due to work of Hatcher, 
              Waldhausen and Gabai, we know the group of homeomorphisms, PL-automorphisms and diffeomorphisms
              also has the isometry group as a deformation-retract.  In dimensions \(\geq 11\), Farrell and Jones used the 
              machinery of Higher Simple Homotopy Theory (K-theory, pseudoisotopy, etc) to show that smooth, PL and 
               topological automorphism groups of compact hyperbolic manifolds do not have the homotopy-type of the 
               isometry group, moreover they do not have the homotopy-type of finite CW-complexes.  We extend these
                results to dimension \(n\geq 4\) by avoiding the use of Higher Simple Homotopy Theory, and constructing diffeomorphisms 
               explicitly using "barbells".

                Abstract: Instanton Floer homology was introduced by Floer in 1980s and it has become a power invariant for three manifolds and knots since then. 
               It has lead to many milestone results, such as the approval of Property P conjecture. Heegaard diagrams, on the other hand, is a 
                combinatorial method to describe and study 3-manifolds. In principle, a Heegaard diagram determines a 3-manifold and hence determines 
               its instanton Floer homology as well. However, no explicit relations between Heegaard diagrams and instanton 
               Floer homology were known until a recent progress by my collaborators and I. In this talk, for a 3-manifold \(Y\), I will 
         present how to extract some information about the instanton Floer homology of \(Y\) from Heegaard diagrams of \(Y\). I will also discuss on
         some applications and possible future directions. This is a joint work with Baldwin and Ye.

               with Heegaard Floer homology. For instance, A. Manion showed that the decategorification of Ozsvath and Szabo's bordered theory 
              coincides with the functor given by Viro. From a different viewpoint, Zhongtao Wu and I studied the Alexander polynomial for MOY graphs 
             (framed trivalent graph with coloring), which is in fact the Euler characteristic of the Heegaard Floer homology of graphs. 
             We later proved that this polynomial is equivalent to Viro's \(U_q(gl(1|1))\)-polynomial. In this talk, we show how to construct a 
             3-manifold invariant from Viro's \(U_q(gl(1|1))\)-polynomial, by following the method proposed by Castantino, Geer and Patureau-Mirand.

             Abstract: There are many interesting obstructions to the existence of smooth embeddings of a surface or 
              3-manifold in a given 4-manifold, and examples of embeddings that are not smoothly isotopic. Often the topological 
             version of existence and uniqueness questions have different answers from the smooth case. In joint work with 
             Dave Auckly, we compare the spaces of smooth and topological embeddings. We show that for many 3-manifolds, 
             there is a large  kernel of the map on the homology and homotopy groups of the space of smooth embeddings to the corresponding space of topological embeddings

               Abstract: A diffeomorphism of a surface with boundary is said to be right-veering if it sends every properly embedded arc in the surface to the right near the boundary. This dynamical notion is intimately related with contact geometry, as shown by Honda-Kazez-Matic. In this talk I'll explain how knot Floer homology can be used to completely detect whether a surface diffeomorphism is right-veering. This gives a purely Floer-theoretic characterization of tight contact structures, and has applications to Dehn surgery and taut foliations. Our proof uses a relationship between Heegaard Floer homology and the periodic Floer homology of surface diffeomorphisms. This is based on joint work with Yi Ni and Steven Sivek.

                Abstract: For an immersed filling of a topological knot, one can do surgery to resolve a double point with the price of 
                  increasing surface genus by 1. In the Lagrangian analog, one can do Lagrangian surgery on immersed Lagrangian fillings to treat a 
                  double point by a genus. In this talk, we will explore the possibility of reversing the Lagrangian surgery, i.e., compressing a genus into a double point. It turns out that not all Lagrangian surgery are reversible.

                Abstract: Given a manifold \(X\), the space of smooth structure on \(X\) (denoted by \(Sm(X)\)) is defined to be the homotopy quotient of the  homeomorphism group by the action of diffeomorphism group. This space measures the difference between the topology of these two groups. In particular, \(Sm(X)\) is always contractible when \(X\) is 3-dimensional or less. In this talk, I will sketch a proof that \(Sm(X)\) has a nontrivial rational homotopy group when \(X\) is any compact orientable 4-manifold \(X\) (with or without boundary) or is the 4-dimensional Euclidean space. This is a joint work with Yi Xie.
